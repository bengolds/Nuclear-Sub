Thanks for checking out Spearmint 1! It wouldn't have been possible without the support of everyone around me. Special thanks to:
- Gamenest, for being the nicest indie co-working space a boy could dream of.
- Tyler Piersall, for the creepy, crackly audio.
- Nicholas Stanford, for enthusiastically testing broken builds.
- My parents, for supporting every weird step on my path that's gotten me here.

Even more special thanks to the creators of the following assets:
